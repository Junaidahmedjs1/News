        <li>1. Narrow Meaning
            <p>This is the education given to the child in the school. The place, duration, curriculum, etc. of such
                education is fixed. In this sense, the person's school life is their education. Mackenzie has written:
                "In a narrow sense, education refers to the conscious efforts made for the development and promotion of
                our powers."</p>
        </li>
        <li>2. Broader Meaning

            The Meaning Of Technology
            <p> The use of scientific inventions, rules, principles, and processes in different aspects of life comes
                under the use of technology. Many types of technologies exist, including educational technology. In
                other words, the application of scientific principles to different areas of life is called technology.
                Therefore, the meaning of technology is "the art of science." Therefore, when scientific, orderly, and
                well-organized knowledge is used to do daily work, then it is given the name of technology. The word
                "technology" is usually associated with machines, but it is not necessary that machines should always be
                used.

                Educational technology affects both the science of education and the art of teaching.</li>
            <li> The practical side of learning is given more importance in educational technology. Educational
                technology affects the student, teacher, administrator, and the entire school environment.</li>
            <li> It simplifies and empowers the teaching/learning process. Educational technology proves helpful in the
                spread of education, and is a continuously developing subject.</li>
            <li> It mainly emphasizes achieving the objectives of education. It is capable of bringing necessary changes
                in the learning situation to fulfill the educational objectives. It is related to cognitive, affective,
                and psychomotor objectives.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Functions Of Educational Technology And The Need For It</li>
            <p>Just as there is a need in our life to use science and technology to get the maximum benefits in the
                least time, using less energy, in the same way educational technology is needed in the field of
                education. The need for educational technology in education is due to the following reasons: It gives
                positive emphasis to the development of the latest methods for effective education. Educational
                technology makes the teaching process scientific, objective, clear, simple, easy, interesting, and
                effective. Educational technology gives proper guidance to solve teaching problems. It provides proper
                guidance to make the teaching/learning process effective, such as setting teaching goals, examining the
                initial behavior of students, selecting and organizing appropriate curricula, appropriate teaching
                methods and strategies, and supporting materials. It offers effective means of communication between
                teachers and learners to engage in the exchange of ideas. It includes the use of all types of arts,
                methods, materials, skills, principles, and instruments of science, psychology, and technology. It can
                be used to arrange and control the learning conditions required to achieve educational technical
                objectives. Just as science and technology help us to do more work with less energy and effort in our
                daily life, in the same way educational technology controls the waste of energy and time in the teaching
                process. It also lays emphasis on the development of appropriate evaluation methods for measuring
                behavior change and for checking the results of the teaching process. After the evaluation process, by
                examining the final behavior of the students, emphasis is also given to providing the expected
                reinforcement and support required.</p>
