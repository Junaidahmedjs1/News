    <h1>What is Forex Trading</h1>
    <p>
        Forex trading essence can be explained like this - the value of a currency is measured by how much another currency can be bought with one unit of it. This is called a price quote. A quote always consists of two prices - bid (bid or ask price) and ask (ask or offer price). You buy currency at the ask price, and when you sell it, at the ask price.

Later in your educational curve you can learn What is Cryptocurrency as well. But if you are interested, we welcome you to jump start now.

I want to note that the offer price of any financial instrument is always higher than the ask price.

The bank will always buy your currency a little cheaper and sell it to you at a higher rate. The spread is the difference between the bid and ask price, which is the commission you pay to a broker for providing services.

Bid and ask prices are available to market participants at any time, except when the market is closed. The trader receives quotes via the Internet from the broker who provided him with a trading account. In turn, the brokerage firm receives price quotes from its liquidity providers, i.e. banks.

Generally speaking, the more liquid the market, the smaller the spread. Usually there are no problems when trading on Forex, and there is more than enough liquidity. However, there are times, for example during the release of important news, when there are gaps (price gaps) due to strong price changes over very short periods of time.

The rest is simple mechanics.

How does Forex Trading Work

So, how does the foreign exchange market work is a question that every beginner should know the answer to.

Trading in the foreign exchange market takes place by clicking on the trading platform that the trader choosed. When an order is placed to buy the EUR/USD currency pair, part of the funds from the trader's account is used to buy the base currency of the EUR/USD pair, in this case, the euro, and sell the quote currency (US dollars).

So, how does the foreign exchange market work is a question that every beginner should know the answer to.
